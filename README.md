ðŸ‘‹ Hello ðŸ‘‹ . 

My name is Brandon. ðŸ’»  I am a ðŸ§› web developer based out of Portland, Oregon.

I love to learn and am continuously pushing myself to grow as a developer. I have over a decade of experience in both managing and training teams of 40+ people and have learned how to successfully navigate difficult situations. These past roles have allowed me to gain experience in developing my ability to see from different perspectives and find ways to manage and address individual needs.

I primarily work with React, JavaScript, and CSS as well as utilizing APIs, TDD, and contributing to opensource projects. You can usually find me trying to create or build something... whether it be brewing my own beer, playing piano, making bread, or building web applications; I get joy from being creative and find reward in the growth/struggle!
