## My name is Brandon. ðŸ’» I am a software enginer at Draftkings based out of Portland, Oregon. 
### I focus onÂ HTML5(semantic tags and SEO),Â CSS (flexbox and grid), and Javascript, as it specifically applies to the UI. IÂ utilizing APIs, TDD, and contributing to opensource projects wheneverÂ I can.

#### I like to prototype in Figma, build with React/Next.js and interact with APIs using GraphQL.

I have over a decade of experience in both managing and training teams of 40+ people and have learned how to successfully navigate difficult situations. These past roles have allowed me to gain experience in developing my ability to see from different perspectives and find ways to manage and address individual needs.

I can usually be found trying to create or build something... whether it be brewing my own beer, playing piano, making bread, or building web applications; I get joy from being creative and find reward in the growth/struggle!
